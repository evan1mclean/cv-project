# CV Maker

This is a React app which allows users to create their own resume using a template I created and generate a PDF of it. The resume form allows you to add additional fields for education and work experience if needed.

This was my first real application made with React and was a good project to become familiar with State, Props, and handling and displaying user input. I also made use of the third party libraries, uuid and react-to-print.
